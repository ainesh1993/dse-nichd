# Mission Statement

For this challenge, we decided to assess the impact of changes in features that were measured across the visits on different pregnancy outcomes. To that extent, we divided the challenge's dataset into several components. 
First, we created our __base__ dataset, which sought to capture pregnant women characteristics _before_ their pregnancies. This consisted of the following files:
- Demographic variables
- Prenatal labs
- Medical history
